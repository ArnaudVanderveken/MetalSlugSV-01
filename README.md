# MetalSlugSV-01

This project is my first year programming final assignment at Digital Arts and Entertainment.
The goal was to recreate an existing 2D game using the given framework, based on SDL.

### Future work
As this project is not the most recent work from me, I'm planning on remaking it using my own custom game engine, once it is developed far enough.
